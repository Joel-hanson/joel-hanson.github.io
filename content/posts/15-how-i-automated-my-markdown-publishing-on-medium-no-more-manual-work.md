### **The Problem: Writing Once, Publishing Twice**  

As a technical writer, I love using **Markdown** for my blog posts. My current setup involves:  

- Writing in Markdown  
- Publishing to my **Hugo** static site  
- As well as sharing on **Medium** for broader reach

But here's the catch: **Medium doesnâ€™t natively support Markdown.** Every time I wanted to cross-post, I had to:  

1. Copy my Markdown content  
2. Manually reformat it in Mediumâ€™s editor  
3. Fix broken code blocks, images, and headings  

This was **time-consuming** and **error-prone**. I needed a better way.  

---

### **The Solution: A Markdown-to-Medium Converter**  

I built a **simple web tool** that:  
âœ… Converts Markdown to **Medium-friendly Content**  
âœ… Preserves **code blocks, images, and formatting**  
âœ… Provides a **live preview** before publishing  
âœ… Lets me **copy content**  

Now, my workflow is seamless:  

1. Write in Markdown (as usual)  
2. Paste into my **converter tool**  
3. Copy the content â†’ Paste into Medium  

No more manual tweaks!

You can find the tool here: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Joel-hanson/markdown2medium)

### **How It Works**  

The tool uses:  

- **`marked.js`** for Markdown parsing  
- **DOM manipulation** to add Mediumâ€™s required CSS classes  
- **Clipboard API** for easy copying  

Example:  

```markdown
# My Post  
This is **bold** text.  

```python  
print("Hello, Medium!")  
```_

```

Gets converted to:  

```html
<h1 class="graf graf--h1">My Post</h1>  
<p class="graf graf--p">This is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">bold</strong> text.</p>  
<pre class="graf graf--pre"><code class="markup--code markup--pre-code">print("Hello, Medium!")</code></pre>  
```  

---

### **Future Plans: Automation with GitHub Actions**  

**Next step:** A **GitHub Action** that:  

1. Watches for new Markdown posts in my Hugo blog  
2. **Auto-converts** them to Medium-ready Content  
3. **Publishes directly** via Mediumâ€™s API  

This would make cross-posting **completely hands-off!**  

---

### **Final Thoughts**  

If youâ€™re a **Markdown writer** who also publishes on Medium, this tool can **save you hours**. No more manual reformattingâ€”just **write once, publish everywhere.**
